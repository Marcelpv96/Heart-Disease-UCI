# MVA-Project

Final Multivariate Analysis project.

The student must perform a multivariate approach of the data matrix
(visualization, clustering and interpretation) plus a prediction model
suitable for the undertaken problem. The student must write a complete
report upon the solution envisaged.

  1- A description of the problem and available data
  
  2- The pre-process of data
  
  3- The protocol of validation
  
  4- The visualisation performed
  
  5- The interpretation of the latent concepts
  
  6- The clustering performed
  
  7- The interpretation of the found clusters
  
  8- Discussion about the differences of the test sample respect to the
  training one
  
  9- The prediction model with its best parameterization and its
  generalization error
  
  10- Scientific and personal conclusions
