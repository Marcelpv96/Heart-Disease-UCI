# MVA-Project

Final Multivariate Analysis project.

The student must perform a multivariate approach of the data matrix
(visualization, clustering and interpretation) plus a prediction model
suitable for the undertaken problem. The student must write a complete
report upon the solution envisaged.

  1- A description of the problem and available data
  
  2- The pre-process of data: do the statement of pre_process.R file, basically detect outliers and missing values (there are no NAs).
  
  3- The protocol of validation: 10-fold CV
  
  4- The visualisation performed: Exploratory data analysis and PCA
  
  5- The interpretation of the latent concepts: EDA and PCA interpretation
  
  6- The clustering performed: Hierarchical clustering, Calinski-Harabasz index, consolidation clustering (hierarchical + k-means)
  
  7- The interpretation of the found clusters: catdes() -> chi-squared and v.test 
  
  8- Discussion about the differences of the test sample respect to the
  training one: frequency distribution difference?
  
  9- The prediction model with its best parameterization and its
  generalization error: we have only seen decision trees
  
  10- Scientific and personal conclusions
